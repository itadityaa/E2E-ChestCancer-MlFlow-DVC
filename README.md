# E2E-ChestCancer-MlFlow-DVC
This repository contains an end-to-end machine-learning project focused on chest cancer detection. It utilizes MLflow for tracking experiments and managing the machine learning lifecycle, along with DVC (Data Version Control) for efficient data management and versioning. The project aims to streamline the model development process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, ensuring reproducibility and collaboration among data scientists.

## Key Features:
End-to-End Workflow: Complete pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment.
Experiment Tracking: Utilizes MLflow to log metrics, parameters, and models for comprehensive tracking.
Data Management: Employs DVC for versioning datasets and managing data pipelines effectively.
Model Evaluation: Implements evaluation metrics to assess model performance and robustness.
